This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an unexpected behavior with regular expressions when using the qr// operator for creating a regex and string interpolation. The bug is that when using a variable inside the regex, it does not properly match, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to correctly use variables in regexes to avoid this issue.
